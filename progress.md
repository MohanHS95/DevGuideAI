## 2025-04-28 - Search Functionality
- Added search functionality to find content across sections
- Implemented real-time search results display
- Added context highlighting for search results
- Enhanced search result styling and interaction
- Implemented search result navigation

## 2025-04-29 - Glossary Integration
- Added glossary functionality to the application
- Implemented a dedicated Glossary button in the header
- Added special styling for glossary terms and definitions
- Integrated automatic linking of glossary terms throughout content
- Added hover effects to show term definitions
- Implemented smooth scrolling to specific terms
- Enhanced document processor to handle glossary term processing and linking

## 2025-04-29
- **Footnote Handling:** Iteratively refined footnote processing logic (`utils/document_processor.py`) to correctly identify and format footnote markers (e.g., `word.1`, `word1`, `[1]`) while preventing section numbers (e.g., `1.1`) from being incorrectly formatted. Addressed issues where initial cleaning attempts removed valid content.
- **Works Cited Formatting:** Updated template (`templates/index.html`) to correctly render the content of the "Works Cited" section as a numbered list using CSS and Jinja logic, removing previous incorrect implementations.
- **References Section:** Removed the per-section footnote reference display as requested.

## 2025-04-30 - Final Footnote Pattern and Heading Exclusion Fixes
- Restored and refined the regex in `process_footnotes` to handle explicit markers (`[1]`, `[footnote-1]`), inline markers (`word1`), and period-based markers (`.1`) while avoiding section number collisions (e.g., `1.1`).
- Updated `process_document` to strictly exclude heading lines from footnote processing, ensuring section headings render correctly.
- Verified Section 1.1 content and Glossary display accurately without artifacts.

## 2025-04-30 - AI Chat Integration
- Switched from OpenAI client to Vertex AI REST `generateContent` (Gemini 2.0 Flash).
- Configured service-account authentication and environment variables (`GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS`, project/region).
- Added `/chat` POST endpoint in `app.py` to refresh tokens and call Gemini API.
- Created front-end chat UI in `templates/index.html` with JS to send/receive messages.

## 2025-05-01 - Chat UI and Mode Toggle Enhancements
- Added chat bubbles with distinct styling for user (blue) and AI (gray), including automatic chunking of long responses
- Introduced Regular Mode and Socratic Mode toggles; implemented separate in-memory chat histories and mode-based system instruction branching
- Updated `/chat` endpoint to accept `mode` parameter and adapt system prompts for each mode while preserving conversation history

## 2025-05-02 - Embedding-Based Retrieval and Multi-Section Synthesis
- Removed fixed-section chat context and now perform embedding-based retrieval across the entire document.
- Installed `sentence-transformers` and replaced Faiss with a numpy cosine similarity approach.
- Implemented `build_embedding_index()` and `get_relevant_sections_embedding()` in `utils/document_processor.py`.
- Updated `/chat` endpoint to call `build_embedding_index()` at startup and fetch multi-section context dynamically.
- Cleaned up front-end by removing explicit context banners, enabling the AI to synthesize answers from all relevant sections.

## 2025-05-03 - Multi-Module Support and UI Polish
- Added a hardcoded modules list and dropdown selector for seven document modules
- Implemented `/modules` landing page with availability cards and "Coming Soon" badges
- Refactored links and templates to propagate the `module` parameter across navigation, search, chat, glossary, and footnotes
- Introduced an "All Modules" button and breadcrumb navigation for improved user orientation

## 2025-05-04 - Chat Panel UX & Learning Mode Prompt Refinements
- Replaced inline chat widget with floating chat bubble and off-canvas panel
- Consolidated mode toggles into a single Chat/Learning Mode switch with dynamic tooltip
- Updated JS to maintain separate histories per mode and render on panel open and mode change
- Enhanced Learning Mode system instruction to implement the Socratic 5 R's method in `/chat`
- Documented CLI commands to pause/resume the Flask server

## 2025-05-05 - Structured Demo Plan Drafted
- Defined a full "Structured Demo Plan" framework (Problem, Solution, Challenges, Results, Lessons)
- Outlined "Demo Design Methodology" steps: scenarios, narrative flow, fallbacks, value connections
- Captured key points for illustrating UI, RAG chat modes, and Socratic Learning Mode
