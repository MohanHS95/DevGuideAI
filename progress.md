## 2025-04-29
- **Footnote Handling:** Iteratively refined footnote processing logic (`utils/document_processor.py`) to correctly identify and format footnote markers (e.g., `word.1`, `word1`, `[1]`) while preventing section numbers (e.g., `1.1`) from being incorrectly formatted. Addressed issues where initial cleaning attempts removed valid content.

- **References Section:** Removed the per-section footnote reference display as requested.

## 2025-04-30 - Final Footnote Pattern and Heading Exclusion Fixes
